# Python Packaing - A technical demonstration

The purpose of this repository is to illustrate how to package Python
projects. The repository contain multiple projects in different flavours as
examples.

The examples try to follow the current state of the art and official
recommendations (e.g. using a `pyproject.toml` and use _Development Mode_ via
`--editable` option). More details can be found in the sub folders.
